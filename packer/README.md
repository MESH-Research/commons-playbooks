# Building

To build, you need [Ansible][ansible] and [Packer][packer]. On OS X, I use 
[Homebrew][brew]:

```sh
brew install ansible packer
```

The playbooks and templates have been most recently tested with:

* OS X 10.10
* Ansible 1.9.0.1
* Packer 0.7.5

Next install the playbook dependencies. In the `ansible` directory, run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
ansible-galaxy install -f -r requirements.yml
```

Configure your build by copying the `ansible/env_vars/commons.yml.example` 
template and populating it.

Now youâ€™re ready to build. In the `packer` directory, run:

```sh
packer build packer.json
```

Boxes are self-hosted on Amazon S3. Use `packer/builds/metadata.json.example` 
as a template for your [box file][vagrant-box].
